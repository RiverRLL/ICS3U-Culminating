This is my culminating project for my grade 11 computer science class. 
I created an app in java called "StockSim" which is a simulation of the stock market. 
Within the app there are 4 stocks that experience price movment similar to stocks on the stock market.
The app consists of a home menu, a buy menu to purchase stocks, a sell menu to sell stocks, and a wallet menu that displays balance and total stock value and gives the option to add money to the account.
