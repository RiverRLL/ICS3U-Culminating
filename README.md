This is my culminating project for my grade 11 computer science class. 
I created an app in java called "StockSim" which is a simulation of the stock market. 
Within the app there are 4 stocks that experience price movment similar to stocks on the stock market.
The app consists of a home menu, a menu to buy stocks, a menu to sell stocks, and a wallet menu that displays balance, total stock value, and the option to add money to the account.
Here is a demonstration of the app: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1DB3FXoq4x2FYk8FHhOVT26R2JNWmVsTm
